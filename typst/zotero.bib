	abstract = {Underrepresented populations are often excluded from genomic studies due in part to a lack of resources supporting their analyses. The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) and Human Genome Diversity Project ({HGDP}), which have recently been sequenced to high coverage, are valuable genomic resources because of the global diversity they capture and their open data sharing policies. Here, we harmonized a high quality set of 4,094 whole genomes from {HGDP} and 1kGP with data from the Genome Aggregation Database ({gnomAD}) and identified over 153 million high-quality {SNVs}, indels, and {SVs}. We performed a detailed ancestry analysis of this cohort, characterizing population structure and patterns of admixture across populations, analyzing site frequency spectra, and measuring variant counts at global and subcontinental levels. We also demonstrate substantial added value from this dataset compared to the prior versions of the component resources, typically combined via liftover and variant intersection; for example, we catalog millions of new genetic variants, mostly rare, compared to previous releases. In addition to unrestricted individual-level public release, we provide detailed tutorials for conducting many of the most common quality control steps and analyses with these data in a scalable cloud-computing environment and publicly release this new phased joint callset for use as a haplotype resource in phasing and imputation pipelines. This jointly called reference panel will serve as a key resource to support research of diverse ancestry populations.},

	abstract = {{KIF}1A-associated neurological disorder ({KAND}) is a neurodegenerative and often lethal ultrarare disease with a wide phenotypic spectrum associated with largely heterozygous de novo missense variants in {KIF}1A. Antisense oligonucleotide treatments represent a promising approach for personalized treatments in ultrarare diseases. Here we report the case of one patient with a severe form of {KAND} characterized by refractory spells of behavioral arrest and carrying a p.Pro305Leu variant in {KIF}1A, who was treated with intrathecal injections of an allele-specific antisense oligonucleotide specifically designed to degrade the {mRNA} from the pathogenic allele. The first intrathecal administration was complicated by an epidural cerebrospinal fluid collection, which resolved spontaneously. Otherwise, the antisense oligonucleotide was safe and well tolerated over the 9-month treatment. Most outcome measures, including severity of the spells of behavioral arrest, number of falls and quality of life, improved. There was little change in the 6-min Walk Test distance, but qualitative changes in gait resulting in meaningful reductions in falls and increasing independence were observed. Cognitive performance was stable and did not degenerate over time. Our findings provide preliminary insights on the safety and efficacy of an allele-specific antisense oligonucleotide as a possible treatment for {KAND}.},

Here we describe the clinical experience with intrathecally administered elsunersen, a gapmer antisense oligonucleotide targeting {SCN}2A, in a female preterm infant with early-onset {SCN}2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, in an expanded access program. Before elsunersen treatement, the patient was in status epilepticus for 7 weeks with a seizure frequency of 20–25 per hour. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed impaired channel inactivation and increased persistent current consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Elsunersen treatment demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe or serious adverse events reported after 19 intrathecal administrations over 20 months. After administration in combination with sodium channel blockers, status epilepticus was interrupted intermittently and ultimately ceased after continued dosing. A {\textgreater}60\% reduction in seizure frequency corresponding to five to seven seizures per hour was observed, which has been sustained during follow-up until the age of 22 months. These data provide preliminary insights on the safety and efficacy of elsunersen in a preterm infant. Additional investigation on the benefits of elsunersen in clinical trials is warranted.},

	abstract = {Despite significant advances in genomic sequencing, the resolution of many rare disease cases is still hindered by variant detection limitations. Short reads struggle in homologous regions, and long reads remain costly and difficult to scale. Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of Illumina’s Constellation sequencing technology for rare disease research. By fragmenting long {DNA} molecules directly on the flow cell surface, Constellation unlocks proximity information that enables long-range phasing and structural variant detection. Across 21 families, Constellation independently identified all known causative variants and resolved previously unsolved trios. It reliably resolved complex structural and copy number variants (e.g. impacting {MECP}2) and recovered haplotype phasing information across key disease impacting variants, all from low {DNA} input using existing Illumina infrastructure. These findings establish Constellation as a scalable, cost-efficient advance, closing critical diagnostic gaps and broadening access to long-range variant analysis in rare disease genomics.},

	abstract = {{SCN}2A variants are one of the most common genetic causes of intractable epilepsy in children, particularly in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies ({DEEs}) which can present with uncontrolled seizures at birth, accounting for 1-2\% of all epileptic encephalopathies.  There is significant genotype-phenotype heterogeneity in {SCN}2A-related disorders ({SRD}) which include neurologic symptoms of seizures, developmental delay, choreoathetosis, and autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}).  A substantial fraction of causal variants is gain-of-functon({GOF}) or mixed function, functionally associated with increased open-probability or greater sodium current flux.  Individualized allele-selective antisense oligonucleotides ({ASOs}) were designed to target heterozygous intronic {SNPs} for decreased expression of mutant {SCN}2A transcript while preserving the wild-type copy.  Efficacy measures were also individualized to phenotype.  Improvements in seizure control, development, and quality-of-life were seen with no {ASO}-related adverse events.  Haplotype phasing in a separate cohort of infants with {SRD} diagnosed by rapid whole genome sequencing identified 16\% of patients with compatible {SNPs}.
